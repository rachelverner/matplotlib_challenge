Three observations or inferences that can be made from the data:
1. Based on final tumor volume by regimen, Capomulin and Ramocane seem to be the most effective in reducing tumor size. 
2. There seems to be a somewhat linear relationship between average tumor volume vs. mouse weight for the Capomulin regimen, which could impact what dosage they may need for an effective treatment. 
3. The R-square value is approximately 0.70, which basically means 70% of of the data fits the regression model.
